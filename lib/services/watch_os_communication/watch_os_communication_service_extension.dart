/// An extension on the [WatchOSCommunicationService] class that provides application-specific methods for interacting
/// with the WatchOS companion app.
///
/// The [WatchOSCommunicationService] class offers a generic interface for managing communication between the Flutter
/// app and the WatchOS app via Method Channel calls. It defines fundamental methods for sending messages, handling
/// responses, and managing asynchronous data transfers, making it suitable for use across multiple projects. These
/// generic capabilities include:
///
/// - Sending messages to the WatchOS app with or without expecting a reply.
/// - Transferring user information or files to the WatchOS app asynchronously.
/// - Updating the application context for the WatchOS app.
/// - Listening for messages or reachability changes from the WatchOS app.
///
/// While the [WatchOSCommunicationService] serves as the foundational communication layer, this
/// extension—[WatchOSCommunicationServiceExtension]—adds methods tailored to the specific requirements of the current
/// application.
///
/// ### Purpose of the Extension
///
/// By separating the generic communication logic from application-specific logic, this architecture allows the
/// [WatchOSCommunicationService] to be easily reused in other projects. Each project can implement its own extension
/// to the [WatchOSCommunicationService] with methods customized to its unique requirements. This design promotes code
/// reusability, maintainability, and modularity.
///
/// ### Benefits of This Design
///
/// 1. **Reusability**: The [WatchOSCommunicationService] can be reused across multiple projects without modification.
///    Each project can implement its own extension to handle application-specific logic.
///
/// 2. **Modularity**: By isolating application-specific methods in an extension, the core [WatchOSCommunicationService]
///    remains focused on generic communication tasks. This reduces complexity and makes the overall system easier to
///    understand and maintain.
///
/// 3. **Scalability**: As the application evolves, new methods can be added to the extension without impacting the
///    core [WatchOSCommunicationService].
///
/// 4. **Ease of Testing**: Generic communication methods and application-specific logic can be tested independently,
///    enabling more targeted unit and integration tests.
